# Striational Antibody-Associated Myositis – Bridging the Gap between Thymoma and Myasthenia Gravis  
_A Systematic Review and Statistical Analysis_

This repository contains the analysis code and figure-generation scripts accompanying the manuscript  
**Striational Antibody-Associated Myositis – Bridging the Gap between Thymoma and Myasthenia Gravis**.

All code is provided to support transparency and reproducibility once the data are available locally.

## How to Reproduce Results

All R scripts are intended to be run **interactively, line by line**, rather than as batch jobs.  
Scripts do **not** write intermediate output files; tables and figures are displayed in the R session.  
Inline comments indicate which code blocks correspond to specific manuscript results.

## 1. Cohort-Specific Analyses (Panels A–D)

Each cohort folder corresponds to one clinical scenario analyzed in the study:

| Folder | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Concomitant IIM and MG/` | Concomitant inflammatory myopathy and myasthenia gravis |
| `Isolated IIM with TET/` | Isolated IIM following thymectomy |
| `Thymoma spontaneous regression/` | Thymoma spontaneous regression cases |
| `ICI-Induced IIM and/or MG/` | Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced IIM and/or MG |

### Workflow

1. Open the corresponding `.R` file in R or RStudio  
2. Set the working directory to the folder containing the script and data  
3. Run the script **line by line**

```r
# Example
setwd("/path/to/Concomitant IIM and MG/")
```

---

## 2. Figures

The `Figures/` directory contains all code and LaTeX components for generating figures.

Each figure folder typically contains:
- an R script for analysis and plotting
- a main `.tex` file assembling the full figure
- (if applicable) a `tex/` subfolder with panel-level LaTeX sources

### Figure compilation workflow

```bash
# Example: Figure 1
Rscript "Figures/Figure 1/Figure 1.R"

# Compile panel-level figures (if applicable)
pdflatex Figures/Figure\ 1/tex/*.tex

# Compile composite figure
latexmk -pdf Figures/Figure\ 1/Figure\ 1.tex
```

---

## Software Requirements

- **R** (version ≥ 4.0)
- R packages listed in `library(...)` calls within each `.R` file
- **LaTeX** distribution (TeX Live or MiKTeX) with `pdflatex` or `latexmk`

(Optional) For reproducible environments:
```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```
